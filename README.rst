Story
======

As a CMG manager, I want to see how you code a game of Tic Tac Toe, so that I can get a feel for a candidate's skills and strengths.

Acceptance criteria
=======================

* The submission must include both server & client side code -- no CLI-only or browser-only implementations
* Quality counts! Take your time on your submission; There is technically no time limit! A good submission that takes a while will be better than a poor submission that took 1 day.
* The AI should never lose


Technical notes
------------------

* We are a Django shop, but it is not a requirement that you implement your program as a Django app.
* Make sure your submission accurately reflects your development style.
* Commit early and often, with good messages.
